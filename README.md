# Poster-Seeker

A game designed and built using the Unity platform. Both the project file and the actual executable (for Windows and Mac OS) are available. This was my project for the Romanian "Certificate of Computer Science".

## How to run

Download the executable either for Windows or Mac OS, adjust the settings as you wish and enjoy. The "Instructions" tab in the game menu explains the idea of the game and how to play it.

## Requirements

To open the project file, the Unity App is required, but to run the actual game there aren't any required programs.
